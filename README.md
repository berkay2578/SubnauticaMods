# SubnauticaMods
- Collection of mods I make in my free time for Subnautica. 

- Mods are always made for the latest version up on Steam.

- No requests.

- Newbies, review [this tutorial](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/152) for getting started.
Once you have installed everything, you can open the .csproj file in whichever mod you want to change,
and update the references for your local install of subnautica and QMod.
